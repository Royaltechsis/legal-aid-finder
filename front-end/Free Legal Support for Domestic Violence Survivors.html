        <h3>Breaking Free from Abuse</h3>

                <p>Leaving an abusive relationship is never easy—especially when the abuser has control over finances, property, and even legal documents. Many victims feel trapped, fearing retaliation or losing custody of their children.</p>

                <h3>Mrs. Peter’s Story</h3>

                <p>Mrs. Peter had been suffering in silence for years. When she finally found the courage to escape, she had nowhere to turn—until a pro bono lawyer stepped in. The legal team helped her:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>File a restraining order to protect her from further abuse</li>
                    <li>Secure full custody of her children</li>
                    <li>Access legal protection for her finances</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>A New Beginning</h3>

                <p>With legal intervention, Mrs. Peter was able to rebuild her life in safety. She regained control of her finances, secured a stable home for her children, and started a new chapter free from fear.</p>

                <h3>How Legal Aid Makes a Difference</h3>

                <p>This case highlights the power of pro bono legal support. Without it, many survivors remain trapped in dangerous situations. Providing free legal aid helps them escape abuse and start fresh.</p>
